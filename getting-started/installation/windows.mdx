<Warning>
Installing our products on Windows is generally not recommended, due to how closed the system is. We recommend using a Linux-based system for better compatibility and performance, or using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run a Linux environment on Windows.
</Warning>

## ⚠️ Before continuing!
This guide expects you to have installed the dependencies listed here:

    <Step title="Download the Bot">
        Download the bot's ZIP file from the marketplace you have bought the bot. The only marketplace's you should trust are listed below:

            </Card>
        </Columns>
        <Warning>If you have bought our product from another marketplace other than the listed above, you may have been scammed and should immediately ask for a refund. (this does not apply to Plex Tickets bought in CodeFling, in which case you must create a ticket to transfer your license)</Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Unzip the Bot">
        Unzip the file into a folder of your choice. Ensure the folder is in an accessible location, such as `C:\Bots\YourBotName`.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open Command Prompt">
        Open the Command Prompt by searching for **"cmd"** in the Start menu and clicking on it. Then, navigate to your bot's directory using the `cd` command. For example:
        ```cmd
        cd C:\Bots\YourBotName
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Modify the config file">
        Open the `config.yml` file in a text editor such as **Visual Studio Code** or **Notepad++**, and configure the bot from there.
        Once all changes have been made, save the file and close your text editor.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install Node.js Modules">
        Install the Node.js modules required for the bot by running:
        ```cmd
        npm install
        ```
        This will install all necessary dependencies as listed in the `package.json` file, which allows the bot to start up.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start the Bot">
        After completing the config file and installed the Node.js modules required for the bot, run the bot with the following command:
        ```cmd
        node index.js
        ```
        Check the terminal output to ensure the bot starts without errors.
    </Step>
